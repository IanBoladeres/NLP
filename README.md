In this work I analysed a corpus containing speeches from the UK Parliament in 2019.

This repository contains the following elements:
 - A PDF file with the document already knitted, perfect for a quick view of the code and the results.
 - An Rmarkdown file with the code and text.
 - A csv file containing the corpus.
 - Two RDS files containing the GloVe, a vector representations for words.
